                Hello! My name is Filip Wilhelmsson and I recently finished my studies as a Game Designer at Futuregames in Stockholm.
                I recently finished my internship at ION Game Design where I originally entered as a System/Tech designer. However, due
                to there being several others within that role and no UI/UX designer I approached the creative PO and asked to be in
                charge of that, to which he obliged.
                <br><br>
                My interest in games started early with games like Super Mario 64, Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Age of Empires 1 & 2.
                It was the late 90's and since then playing games have been a major part of my personal life.
            </p>
            <p class="info-text">
                In 2022 I started studying Game Design even though it wasn't my first choice at the time, but I immediately realized
                that this is something I want to do for the rest of my life.
                <br><br>
                My favorite parts of game design is the explorative nature which rewards curiosity and trying new ideas.
                The second part I love is the iterative process, where small continuous adjustments can shape your idea into something wonderful.
                <br><br>
                Besides making and playing games I love cooking and everything surrounding it. I bake my own sourdough bread.
                I ferment my own kimchi etc. And the reason why I love this so much is probably for the same reason I love game design.
                It rewards curiosity in terms of flavor combinations and iterating on recipes make them even better!
