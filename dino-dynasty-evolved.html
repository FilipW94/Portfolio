                    Dino Dynasty Evolved is a game I worked on for 8 months between May-December 2025.
                    Which was expected to be about half of the production time.
                    I was there in an intern capacity, and initially I was meant to work as system/tech designer.
                    But since I had been thinking of switching to UI/UX design with focus on implementation and
                    the more technical side, I reached out to our contact person at the company and asked to be
                    in charge of UI for the project. To which they agreed.<br><br>

            The Popup system was made to be reusable everywhere and has 2 available buttons.
            The default button that is always visible is <strong class="strong-text blue">Confirm</strong>. The second optional button 
            is a <strong class="strong-text red">Cancel</strong> button. The popup widget also has an <strong>OnPopupReply</strong> event that returns a 
            boolean. This can be used to run different logic depending on the return value.
            <br><br>
            General uses for the Popup is to display information that you need to make sure the player doesn't miss, 
            hence why its removal is dependent on input.
            A specific example of when both the <strong class="strong-text blue">Confirm</strong> and <strong class="strong-text red">Cancel</strong> button 
            is used is when the player is assigning keybindings via the control settings. If they try to bind a button that already has an active binding, 
            the <strong class="strong-text blue">Confirm</strong> button will swap the input bindings and save, while <strong class="strong-text red">Cancel</strong> 
            will prevent the action. Both inputs then close the popup.
            <br><br>
            The Popup widget can also display an <strong class="strong-text blue">Image</strong> or <strong class="strong-text blue">Video</strong>. 
            This can further clarify new mechanics or systems that simple text might struggle to convey. In DDE we opted to use short ability previews
            on the popup whenever a player unlocked a new base ability. As well as making them viewable from their corresponding skill tree 
            by pressing <strong class="strong-text blue">Y</strong>. This helped the player grasp the ability quicker than just reading.
            <br><br>
            Below you have a typical setup when using the <strong class="strong-text blue">popup system</strong>. You create the widget and 
            call an <strong class="strong-text blue">interface function</strong> on the <strong class="strong-text blue">HUD</strong> class attached 
            to the <strong class="strong-text blue">player controller</strong>. This will safely open the widget above any other UI elements and set 
            focus on the widget.

                This variable in <strong>UpdateActivePrompt</strong> was a minor safety implementation that would just create a new

            Since we used both KBM and Controller, as well as a key-rebinding system. We needed a way to display what input each action was bound to. 
            For that reason I set up a:
        </p>
        <ul class="text preview-content list">
            <li>Material to show the icons<br></li>
            <li>Data Table to hold all the keybinding icons<br></li>
            <li>Functionality to fetch and display the icon<br></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text preview-header">M_IconPicker</p>
        <p  class="text preview-content"> 
            The material used to display the icons uses a sprite sheet with the icons for each device.<br>
        </p>

            The user assigns the grid dimensions for the sprite sheet, the row and column indexes are then used to find the correct icon.<br><br>

            A material instance was created for each input device.<br>

            The data table uses the row name of the actual input. The row then contains the material instance of the input device, 
            row index and column index. All things you need to display the icon.
            <br><br>
            This setup reduced the need for <strong class="strong-text red">100+</strong> material instances <strong class="strong-text blue">down to 3</strong>, 
            while also <strong class="strong-text blue">reducing the amount of time</strong> it takes to assign each row since you don't have to locate the asset everytime. 
            You just copy the row and type the buttons row/column index.

        <p class="text preview-content">
            Now that a collection of all the input icons had been created, I just needed to fetch it. This was done by 
            having a reference to the <strong class="strong-text blue">input action</strong> tied to an ability, the gameplay 
            <strong class="strong-text blue">input mapping context</strong> and discerning what <strong class="strong-text blue">input device</strong> is being used. 
            With this information I could find the input name and use it to fetch the input icon data from the data table.

        <p class="text preview-content">
            This logic was then ran when: <br>

        <ul class="text preview-content list">
            <li>The game started</li>
            <li>When an action was re-bound</li>
            <li>when the event <strong>OnInputMethodChanged</strong> fired (CommonUI plugin event)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text preview-content"> 
        In the video I use xbox controller and re-bind the bite ability from Y to B. Then I also start using my 
            keyboard and mouse which triggers the <strong>OnInputMethodChanged</strong> event.

            The game had 3 resources, and we needed to display acquisition in a clear but non-intrusive way.<br><br>

            When a resource is acquired it will show the corresponding resource icon with the amount gained. If no new resources is gained 
            within <strong class="strong-text blue">1.5 seconds</strong> it will fade out. If a new resource is collected it will update the 
            acquisition log again and reset the duration. All resources always fade-out simultaneously  <br><br>
            If a resource is collected while the fade out widget animation is playing, it will <strong class="strong-text blue">reverse the fade-out</strong>, 
            making it look smooth.<br><br>
            Originally we had the total resources displayed <strong class="strong-text red">center-left</strong> instead of 
            <strong class="strong-text blue">bottom-left</strong>. During this time I also made an animation where the gained amount shot into the 
            total amount. But since collecting resources is something the player does frequently, we opted for a <strong class="strong-text blue">less visually stimulating effect</strong>.<br><br>

            The ability button is an indicator for the different characteristics of an ability. This includes key-binding, cooldown, held duration and charges.<br><br>
            To display all this information I made use of the <strong class="strong-text blue">internal space</strong> for the 
            <strong class="strong-text blue">cooldown</strong> and <strong class="strong-text blue">held-progress indication</strong>,
            while showing the <strong class="strong-text red">keybinding</strong> and <strong class="strong-text red">available charges</strong> on the <strong class="strong-text red">outside</strong> of the indicator for abilities that had charges.<br><br>

        <p class="text preview-content"> 
            Since the ability buttons are placed in an <strong class="strong-text red">arc</strong> in the bottom-left corner, 
            <strong class="strong-text blue">their rotation had to be manipulated</strong>. This caused the ability icon (white) and keybinding
            to be rotated as well. this was solved by creating a function in the ability button class that <strong class="strong-text blue">checks its own rotation</strong>, 
            and then <strong class="strong-text red">subtracts</strong> that from the keybinding and icon.<br>

            At the time of implementation the amount of max charges an ability could have hadn't been decided yet. So I made it work with up to 
            <strong class="strong-text red">4 charges</strong> by creating simple textures that are assigned in the child blueprint class. 
            The ability button then checks how many charges it's corresponding ability has and applies the correct one.<br><br>

            Charges are then displayed by checking CurrentCharges/MaxCharges. At the time my internship we had plans to add new textures for 
            charges <strong class="strong-text red">but were using the old ones from when our ability button was circular</strong>. That's why 
            they don't fit very well. <br><br>

            For The general horizontal tab layout I used the <strong class="strong-text blue">CommonUI Tablist class</strong>. It has functionality

            Our settings menus use a <strong class="strong-text blue">settings slider class</strong> placed inside either a vertical box or a scroll box. 
            A <strong class="strong-text red">problem</strong> here was that we wanted to use <strong class="strong-text blue">vertical analog inputs</strong> 
            for <strong class="strong-text blue">navigation</strong>, but <strong class="strong-text red">horizontal analog inputs</strong> to
            <strong class="strong-text red">change the settings option</strong>. For this reason I didn't use the default navigation system and instead set up some custom logic.
            <br><br>
            The <strong class="strong-text blue">parent widget</strong> holding all the sliders consume the <strong class="strong-text blue">vertical</strong>
            analog inputs and move between the different slider.

            because the sheer amount <strong class="strong-text red">wouldn't fit</strong> in the large skill trees, but also 
            because of the connections between them. To set this up I used the <strong class="strong-text blue">default navigation</strong> 
            which uses vertical/horizontal movement and tested moving between all the nodes to find what felt good or not.

            An added bonus was to also check the <strong class="strong-text blue">current input type</strong>. This would <strong class="strong-text blue">prevent</strong>
